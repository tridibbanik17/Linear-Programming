# Linear Programming

This project provides code to solve linear optimization problems using the **IBM CPLEX LP solver** available on [NEOS Server](https://neos-server.org/neos/solvers/lp:CPLEX/LP.html).  
NEOS offers free access to CPLEX for academic and research purposes, enabling users to model and solve LP problems without requiring a local CPLEX installation.
